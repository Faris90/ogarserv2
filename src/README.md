To start the server, run ./runserver.sh this will check for JXcore installed and if not, installes it. And then checks if the needed modules are installed. If not it will install this as well.

Where is Agar ? where is Ogar ?
We removed the 2 packages and made it one, you now in the gameserver.ini can choose the server protocol. More easy for me as well now only have to compile one server!
